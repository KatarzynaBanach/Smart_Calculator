## Smart Calculator
The program not only calculates expressions (that use +, -, (), /, //, *) but also saves variables in dictionary and later use them in calculations. In order to avoid errors it also checks if expression and variables name (may consist of letters only) is correct. Program operates on integers only, since it was an assumption provided by author of the course.

Created while doing a course 'Python Core' on hyperskill.org, based on general schema and guidelines provided by course author (but solutions designed on my own). It was great possibility to practice using of **_re library, loops, dictionaries on more advanced level._**

Technologies used:
- python
- libraries: **_re_**

**Above example how program works, input marked with yellow color**
