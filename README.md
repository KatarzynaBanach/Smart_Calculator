## Smart Calculator
The program not only calculates expressions (that use +, -, (), /, //, *) but also saves variables in dictionary and later use them in calculations. In order to avoid errors it also checks if expression and value name (may consist of letters only) is correct.

Created while doing a course 'Python Core' on hyperskill.org, based on general schema and guidelines provided by course author (but solutions designed on my own). It was great possibility to practice using of **_re library, loops, dictionaries on more advanced level._**

Technologies used:
